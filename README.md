**nuxt-env** inject env vars for your Nuxt app at runtime

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/samtgarson/nuxt-env.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/samtgarson/nuxt-env)

## Why

Nuxt currently provides a very [handy way of injecting environment variables](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-env) which uses webpack substitution to inject your env vars at build time. This works most of the time, but if your build process is environment-agnostic (e.g. if you build a Docker image on CI and use the same image for staging and production), you end up with a result which has the environment baked into it (meaning that in our example, the docker image would be coupled to the environment it was built in).

This module allows you to read environment variables server side—at runtime—and inject them into your app, meaning your Nuxt bundle is decoupled from your environment variables.

⚠️ **WARNING**: As with the `config.env` option in Nuxt config, environment variables used in `nuxt-env` are exposed client side, so don't use it for storing secrets! ⚠️ 

## Usage

`nuxt-env` injects your environment variables into your Nuxt app using `this.$env`.

_**N.B.** If currently use Nuxt's `config.env` option, fear not—`nuxt-env` includes those env vars in the `$env` object._

### Get Setup

1. Install the dependency:
```bash
yarn add nuxt-env
```

2. Add to your `nuxt.config.js` and configure:
```js
// nuxt.config.js

// Tell nuxt-env which env vars you want to inject
modules: [
  'other-nuxt-module',
  ['nuxt-env', {
    keys: ['TEST_VALUE']
  }]
]
```


### Use in your application

- Use `this.$env` in your components:
```js
// any-component.vue

export default {
  computed: {
    testValue () { return this.$env.TEST_VALUE }
  }
}
```

- and in your Nuxt context
```js
// any-component.vue

export default {
  asyncData ({ app }) {
    console.log(app.$env.TEST_VALUE)
  }
}
```

- and in your store:
```js
// store/index.js

export const mutations = {
  storeEnv (commit) {
    const val = this.$env.TEST_VALUE
    commit('testValue', val)
  }
}
```


## Develop

```bash
# Forlk the repo
git clone git@github.com:your_username/nuxt-env.git
cd nuxt-env
yarn
yarn test

# To use while developing other apps:
yarn link
cd ../my-other-app
yarn link nuxt-env
```
